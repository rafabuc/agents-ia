# Conditionals in English - B1-B2 Level

## Introduction to Conditionals

Conditionals express **"if...then"** situations - what happens or might happen under certain conditions. English has several types of conditionals, each with different uses and meanings.

## The Four Main Conditional Types

### 1. Zero Conditional (General Truths/Facts)

**Structure:** If + present simple, present simple

**Use:** For facts, scientific truths, or things that are always true

**Examples:**
- If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.
- If it rains, the ground gets wet.
- If you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
- Plants die if they don't get enough water.

**Time:** Any time / Always

### 2. First Conditional (Real Future Possibility)

**Structure:** If + present simple, will + base verb

**Use:** For real or likely future situations

**Examples:**
- If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay home.
- If you study hard, you'll pass the exam.
- We'll go to the beach if the weather is nice.
- If she doesn't hurry, she'll miss the bus.

**Time:** Future

**Note:** Can also use: may/might/can instead of will
- If you help me, I might finish earlier.
- If it rains, we can watch a movie instead.

### 3. Second Conditional (Unreal/Hypothetical Present)

**Structure:** If + past simple, would + base verb

**Use:** For impossible, unreal, or very unlikely present/future situations

**Examples:**
- If I won the lottery, I would travel the world. (I probably won't win)
- If I were you, I would accept the job. (But I'm not you)
- If she had more time, she would learn French. (But she doesn't have time)
- What would you do if you saw a ghost? (Hypothetical)

**Time:** Present or Future (but imaginary)

**Special Note:** Use "were" for all persons with "to be"
- ✅ If I were rich... (formal/correct)
- ❌ If I was rich... (less formal, but common in speech)

---

### 4. Third Conditional (Unreal Past)

**Structure:** If + past perfect, would have + past participle

**Use:** For imaginary past situations (things that didn't happen)

**Examples:**
- If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam. (But I didn't study)
- If they had left earlier, they wouldn't have missed the flight. (But they left late)
- She would have come to the party if you had invited her. (But you didn't invite her)
- If we had known about the traffic, we would have taken a different route.

**Time:** Past (imagining different past)

---

## Mixed Conditionals

### Past Condition → Present Result

**Structure:** If + past perfect, would + base verb

**Example:**
- If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now. (past action → present result)

### Present Condition → Past Result

**Structure:** If + past simple, would have + past participle

**Example:**
- If I were smarter, I would have solved the problem. (permanent condition → past result)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Wrong: If I will see him, I will tell him.
✅ Correct: If I see him, I will tell him.
(Don't use "will" in the if-clause for first conditional)

### ❌ Wrong: If I would have more money, I would buy it.
✅ Correct: If I had more money, I would buy it.
(Don't use "would" in the if-clause for second conditional)

### ❌ Wrong: If I would have known, I would have helped.
✅ Correct: If I had known, I would have helped.
(Use past perfect in if-clause for third conditional)

## Unless, As Long As, Provided That

### Unless = If not
- I'll go unless it rains. = I'll go if it doesn't rain.
- Unless you hurry, you'll be late. = If you don't hurry, you'll be late.

### As long as / Provided that = If (emphasizing condition)
- You can borrow my car as long as you drive carefully.
- I'll help you provided that you help me later.

## Practice Tips

1. **Start with Zero and First** - These are most common in daily life
2. **Think about time** - Is it always true? Future? Past that didn't happen?
3. **Pay attention to verb forms** - Each conditional has specific patterns
4. **Practice with real situations** - Make sentences about your own life
5. **Listen to native speakers** - Notice which conditionals they use when

## Cultural Note

In American English, "If I was..." is commonly used in informal speech for second conditional, though "If I were..." is grammatically correct and preferred in formal writing.

**Informal:** If I was rich, I'd buy a yacht.
**Formal:** If I were rich, I would buy a yacht.

## Next Steps

After mastering basic conditionals:
1. Learn **wish** and **if only** for expressing regrets
2. Study **inversion** in conditionals (Had I known... / Were I rich...)
3. Practice **mixed conditionals** for complex situations
4. Explore **implied conditionals** (Without you, I'd be lost = If you weren't here...)
